Round Robin Scheduling (Time Quantum = 3)
P1 runs from 0 to 3
P2 runs from 3 to 6 (Completed)
P3 runs from 6 to 9
P4 runs from 9 to 12
P1 runs from 12 to 14 (Completed)
P3 runs from 14 to 17
P4 runs from 17 to 20 (Completed)
P3 runs from 20 to 22 (Completed)

Priority-Based Scheduling
P1 (Priority 2) runs from 0 to 5
P4 (Priority 0) runs from 5 to 11
P2 (Priority 1) runs from 11 to 14
P3 (Priority 3) runs from 14 to 22
